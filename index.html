					The Barley Mow Inn is a 18th century pub based in Kirk Ireton, Ashbourne, Derbyshire. The Barley Mow Inn is renowned for providing an unspoilt, traditional pub experience often described as ‘stepping back in time’. The Barley Mow offers a range of real ales straight from the cask, local ciders and perries, and its own Barley Mow Brewery ales. These are all accompanied by delicious home-made food at weekends, using locally sourced ingredients and made in the pub.
